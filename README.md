# MassCulture_Project
 Final Project for Mass Culture(Arts Organization of Canada)
The project focused on analyzing the Canadian art charity sector to assess financial health, operational efficiency, and fundraising effectiveness. The team used dashboards and data analysis techniques to study metrics from 2018 to 2021, covering revenue, expenses, and government funding. Key insights included financial disparities, particularly among Quebec charities, and a variation in fundraising success across charity subcategories. Music & Sound and Performing Arts charities showed strong fundraising performance, supported by government funding that targeted project and fixed expenses. The macroeconomic analysis showed resilience despite the pandemic, with stable GDP per capita across provinces.

In the second phase, the team applied advanced analysis, including predictive modeling and natural language processing (NLP). They used Random Forest and XGBoost models to classify charity efficiency levels, with Random Forest achieving slightly higher accuracy and XGBoost performing better in precision for certain categories. However, both models struggled with the 'EF high' category, highlighting room for improvement in handling imbalanced classes. Hyperparameter tuning improved XGBoost's accuracy, particularly for challenging categories, emphasizing the importance of iterative model refinement.

In conclusion, the project demonstrated that a data-driven approach can guide strategic decisions for charities, especially in financial management and fundraising. The study recommended focusing on operational efficiency and utilizing additional economic indicators for a more comprehensive sector analysis.
